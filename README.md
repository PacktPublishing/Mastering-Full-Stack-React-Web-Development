# Mastering Full-Stack React Web Development

This is the code repository for [Mastering Full Stack React Web Development](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-full-stack-react-web-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786461766), published by [Packt](www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
Full-stack web development is being redefined by the impact of ReactJS. If MEAN demonstrated just how effective combining JavaScript frameworks and tools could be for the modern web developer, by replacing Angular with React, developers have an easier way to build isomorphic web applications where code can run on both the client and server.

This book will get you up to speed with one of the latest strategies to meet the demands of today’s dynamic and data-intensive web. Combining detailed insights and guidance with practical and actionable information that will ensure you can build a complete isomorphic web app, it’s an essential resource for the forward-thinking developer.

You’ll learn how to create a reliable and powerful back-end platform with Node.js and Express, as well as exploring how to use MongoDB as the primary database. You’ll see how its flexibility is a core part of any full-stack developer’s workflow, as well as learning how to use Mongoose alongside it to make data storage safer and more reliable.
